    "'''Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "Multithreading in Python is the concurrent execution of more than one task (thread) at a time within a program. It allows you to execute multiple threads in parallel, potentially improving the efficiency of certain types of programs. Threads are lightweight processes that share the same memory space but can execute independently. In Python, multithreading is commonly used to make programs more efficient, especially when there are tasks that are I/O bound (like network operations, reading from or writing to a file).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Multithreading Used?\n",
    "Multithreading is used to achieve several goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency: It helps in running multiple tasks concurrently, which is especially useful when tasks are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Performance: Multithreading is particularly useful when there are I/O-bound tasks like waiting for data from a network or reading large files. While one thread is waiting for I/O operations, others can continue executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Sharing: Since threads in the same program share the same memory space, they can efficiently share resources like data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsiveness: It can improve the responsiveness of programs, especially those with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where you don't want the main interface to freeze while background tasks are running.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it’s worth noting that Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the true parallel execution of threads in CPU-bound tasks, so for computationally intensive tasks, multiprocessing might be more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module Used to Handle Threads in Python\n",
    "In Python, the threading module is used to work with threads. It provides a higher-level interface to create, manage, and control threads.'''"
