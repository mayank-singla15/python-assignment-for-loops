Who developed Python Programming Language?

Python was developed by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991.
Which type of Programming does Python support?

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural programming, object-oriented programming (OOP), and functional programming.
Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?

Yes, Python is case-sensitive. For example, Variable and variable would be considered different identifiers.
What is the correct extension of the Python file?

The correct extension for a Python file is .py.
Is Python code compiled or interpreted?

Python code is interpreted, meaning it is executed line-by-line by the Python interpreter.
Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?

Some common code blocks in Python are:
Functions: Defined using def.
Loops: for and while loops.
Conditionals: if, elif, else.
Classes: Defined using class.
Try-Except blocks for exception handling.
State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?

The character used for single-line comments is #.
Mention functions which can help us to find the version of Python that we are currently working on?

You can use the function sys.version or platform.python_version() to find the Python version.
Example:

python
Copy code
import sys
print(sys.version)
Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called?

Python supports anonymous functions using the lambda construct.
What does pip stand for in Python?

pip stands for "Pip Installs Packages", and it is a package manager for Python, used to install and manage Python libraries.
Mention a few built-in functions in Python?

Some built-in functions in Python are:
print()
len()
type()
input()
str()
int()
min(), max()
sum()
What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?

Python identifiers can be of any length, though it's recommended to keep them reasonably short for readability.
What are the benefits of using Python?

Benefits of Python include:
Simple and easy-to-read syntax
Large standard library
Cross-platform compatibility
Object-oriented and functional programming support
Extensive community support and resources
Great for rapid development and prototyping
How is memory managed in Python?

Python uses automatic memory management through reference counting and garbage collection (GC) to reclaim memory used by objects that are no longer in use.
How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?

To install Python on Windows:
Download the Python installer from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Run the installer and make sure to check the box to add Python to your system PATH during installation.
After installation, verify it by opening a Command Prompt and typing python --version.
If you didn't check the box to add Python to PATH:

Go to the installation directory (e.g., C:\Python39).
Add this directory to the PATH environment variable manually through System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables.
Is indentation required in Python?

Yes, indentation is required in Python and is used to define blocks of code instead of braces ({}). Consistent indentation (typically 4 spaces) is crucial for Python code to function correctly.
